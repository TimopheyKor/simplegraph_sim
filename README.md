# simplegraph_sim: A Simple Graph Simulator
An interactive, educational simulator for simple graph theory. Draw, generate, and learn about graphs.
Built in Go using the [Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) library.

## The Goal
This project is mainly meant to be a resource for teaching & learning mathematical [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), which is often covered in subjects such as discrete mathematics or combinatorics.
While it's currently bare-bones with little functionality, the goal is for it to become an open-ended playground which encourages the exploration of graph theory.
